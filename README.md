## Videos

Most are likely familiar with KhanAcademy's math videos and corresponding problem sets. In my view the problem sets are good for "drill and kill" style problems and they are well mapped out. With all due respect, Khan's math videos themselves are middle-of-the-road in terms of quality. This is likely due to lack of planning.

Here are several video producers that feature superior calculus content. 

 1. https://www.youtube.com/user/patrickJMT Plain video production (hand + black marker on a whiteboard) and very tightly focused, usually starting with a short (<30 second) motivation and then a fully explained example problem. Great for seeing examples of problems being carefully solved. 
 2. http://www.midnighttutor.com/math_tutor_online.php Special mention for not even being on youtube ([well, actually](https://www.youtube.com/user/midnighttutor/videos)). These are longer (15-30 minute) videos that go into great detail, usually dealing with multi-part problems of difficulty at or slightly above the Advanced Placement level.
 3. https://www.youtube.com/user/turksvids Screencast of a digital whiteboard, of particular value to AP Students are the AP Calculus Free Response playlist where several years worth of previously released exam problems are solved step by step.
 4. https://www.mathtv.com/ Again, not originally on youtube ([although](https://www.youtube.com/user/MathTV)) but well worth mentioning for lots of example problems solved similarly to PatrickJMT.
 5. https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-006-calculus-revisited-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/ MIT's videos are of mixed quality, and Herb Gross's 1970 series of calculus videos is a treasure. Each is ~90 minutes long, and he delves into considerable theory, but his presentation is extremely clean and well prepared. It is interesting to note that he starts each video calm and perhaps stilted, but after a few minutes he gets into a groove and you can see he is genuinely excited about the material.
